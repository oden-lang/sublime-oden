# sublime-oden
Oden support in Sublime 2/3.

- Syntax highlighting
- Option to run the currently edited Oden file.

# Using this plugin

For now, it's enough to copy the whole folder to your User package folder.

For Sublime 3 on OSX, select _Sublime Text->Preferences->Browse Packages..._ from the menu. In the finder window that opens up, go into the _User_ folder and drop the `oden.tmLanguage` file there. You may have to restart Sublime for the plugin to be activated.

# Developing this plugin

This is easiest done with the [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev) plugin.

There is a quick "Getting Started" at the [Sublime Text Unofficial Documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html) site.
